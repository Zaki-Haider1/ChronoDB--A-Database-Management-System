   ChronoDB SQL Command Reference
========================================

=== BASIC OPERATIONS ===

1. CREATE TABLE
   Syntax: CREATE TABLE <table_name> (<field1> <type>, <field2> <type>, ...);
   Example: CREATE TABLE students (id INT, name STRING, gpa FLOAT);
   
2. INSERT
   Syntax: INSERT INTO <table_name> VALUES <id> <name> <gpa>;
   Example: INSERT INTO students VALUES 1 Alice 3.8;
   Example: INSERT INTO students VALUES 2 Bob 3.5;

3. SELECT
   Syntax: SELECT * FROM <table_name>;
   Example: SELECT * FROM students;
   Note: Shows all records in formatted table

4. UPDATE
   Syntax: UPDATE <table_name> SET <field> <value> WHERE ID <id>;
   Example: UPDATE students SET gpa 4.0 WHERE ID 1;
   Example: UPDATE students SET name Charlie WHERE ID 2;
   Valid Fields: NAME, GPA

5. DELETE
   Syntax: DELETE FROM <table_name> WHERE ID <id>;
   Example: DELETE FROM students WHERE ID 2;
   Note: Removes record by ID

6. UNDO
   Syntax: UNDO;
   Example: UNDO;
   Note: Reverts the last operation (CREATE, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE)

7. REDO
   Syntax: REDO;
   Example: REDO;
   Note: Re-applies the last undone operation

8. EXIT
   Syntax: EXIT; (or exit; - case insensitive)
   Example: exit;
   Note: Closes the ChronoDB CLI

========================================

=== GRAPH OPERATIONS ===

1. CREATE GRAPH
   Syntax: GRAPH CREATE <graph_name>;
   Example: GRAPH CREATE myGraph;
   Note: Creates a new graph structure

2. DELETE GRAPH
   Syntax: GRAPH DELETE <graph_name>;
   Example: GRAPH DELETE myGraph;
   Note: Removes a graph

3. ADD VERTEX
   Syntax: GRAPH ADDVERTEX <graph_name> <vertex_name>;
   Example: GRAPH ADDVERTEX myGraph A;
   Example: GRAPH ADDVERTEX myGraph B;
   Note: Adds a node to the graph

4. REMOVE VERTEX
   Syntax: GRAPH REMOVEVERTEX <graph_name> <vertex_name>;
   Example: GRAPH REMOVEVERTEX myGraph A;
   Note: Removes a node from the graph

5. ADD EDGE
   Syntax: GRAPH ADDEDGE <graph_name> <vertex1> <vertex2> <weight>;
   Example: GRAPH ADDEDGE myGraph A B 5;
   Example: GRAPH ADDEDGE myGraph B C 10;
   Note: Creates connection between two vertices with weight

6. PRINT GRAPH
   Syntax: GRAPH PRINT <graph_name>;
   Example: GRAPH PRINT myGraph;
   Note: Displays the entire graph structure

7. BREADTH-FIRST SEARCH
   Syntax: GRAPH BFS <graph_name> <start_vertex>;
   Example: GRAPH BFS myGraph A;
   Note: Traverses graph level by level from start vertex

8. DEPTH-FIRST SEARCH
   Syntax: GRAPH DFS <graph_name> <start_vertex>;
   Example: GRAPH DFS myGraph A;
   Note: Traverses graph depth by depth from start vertex

9. DIJKSTRA'S SHORTEST PATH
   Syntax: GRAPH DIJKSTRA <graph_name> <start_vertex> <end_vertex>;
   Example: GRAPH DIJKSTRA myGraph A C;
   Note: Finds shortest path between two vertices

========================================

=== EXAMPLE WORKFLOW ===

ChronoDB> CREATE TABLE students (id INT, name STRING, gpa FLOAT);
[SUCCESS]: Table 'students' created.

ChronoDB> INSERT INTO students VALUES 1 Alice 3.8;
[SUCCESS]: Record inserted.

ChronoDB> INSERT INTO students VALUES 2 Bob 3.5;
[SUCCESS]: Record inserted.

ChronoDB> SELECT * FROM students;
+----+-------+-----+
| ID |  NAME | GPA |
+----+-------+-----+
|  1 | Alice | 3.8 |
|  2 |  Bob  | 3.5 |
+----+-------+-----+

ChronoDB> UPDATE students SET gpa 4.0 WHERE ID 1;
[SUCCESS]: Record updated.

ChronoDB> DELETE FROM students WHERE ID 2;
[SUCCESS]: Record deleted.

ChronoDB> UNDO;
[SUCCESS]: Last action undone successfully.

ChronoDB> SELECT * FROM students;
+----+-------+-----+
| ID |  NAME | GPA |
+----+-------+-----+
|  1 | Alice | 4.0 |
|  2 |  Bob  | 3.5 |
+----+-------+-----+

ChronoDB> exit;

========================================

=== IMPORTANT NOTES ===

- All commands must end with a semicolon (;)
- Table names, field names, and vertex names are case-sensitive
- Commands (CREATE, UPDATE, SELECT, etc.) are case-insensitive
- The EXIT command works in any case (exit, EXIT, Exit, etc.)
- Records are identified by their ID (integer)
- GPA must be a float value (e.g., 3.8, 4.0)
- UNDO/REDO maintain a stack of operations
- Graph operations require vertices to exist before adding edges between them
